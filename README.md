The executable build is not very functional at the moment and serves more of a showcase of the project in action.
To properly see and adjust parameters open the project in Unity. The population size, trial time and the speed the game is running at can all be changed through the population script components in the BotSpawner object.
Fitness of individual agents can be observed by selecting them during runtime and viewing the PlayerScript component.

Will continue development on the main branch for a bit, the build submitted for the deadline can be viewed on the aptly named branch.
